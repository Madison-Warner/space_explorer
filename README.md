# About my Space Explorer project
For this project, I was tasked with creating an algorithm enabling a spaceship to find and travel to a treasure planet before running out of fuel. All planets were randomly generated and given a special ID. At a random distance, one of these planets was designated as the "Treasure "Planet. The planets are connected like nodes on a tree graph, meaning you can only travel from one planet to its' connected planets. To handle dead ends this program uses backtracking so that when a dead end is met, the ship travels back to the previous planet and travels down the next closest planet.
